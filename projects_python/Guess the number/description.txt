Project - Guess the number
Welcome to our course on Building Projects using Python.

In each module, we will build one project, step by step. First we will start with a demo of the final project we are going to build, 
then in each lesson we will implement functionality one by one.

In this module we will build a simple Guess the Number game.

Click on Run button to play around with the game in the console to understand how it functions. 
The project will take some time to load for the first time. Please be patient.

Rules of the game

The computer generates a random number between 1 to 100 and you need to guess the number
If your guess is greater than the number by 10 or lower than the number by 10 - the system will output 'Cold'
If your guess is within a + / - 10 range from the number, the system will output 'Hot'
You have unlimited attempts.
