Project - Hangman

Play around with the project in the console to understand how it functions - you will code it out in this module.

What is happening in this Project?

We are playing a word guessing game
The rules are as follows
    The length of the word is the count of chances or guesses that you get.
    For every guess - whether correct or incorrect - total guesses is reduced by 1
    For every guess, the following is displayed
        If the guess is correct, the letter gets displayed at its correct position
        If the guess is incorrect, an error message is provided to the user
    Conditions for 'Winning'
        If all letters are correctly guessed
AND if all chances / guesses count is not yet 0
